# BLINKIT-ANALYSIS
This project uses Blinkit data to study sales and customer ratings. It cleans fat content names like ‘lf’ and ‘reg’. Then it checks total and average sales in 2022. It also finds how many items were sold and the average rating. Finally, it shows which fat type had more sales and items.
